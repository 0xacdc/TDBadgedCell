		<h3><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> Meet TDBadgedCell version 2</h3>
		<p>
			TDBadgedCell grew out of the need for TableViewCell badges and the lack of them in iOS (see the article explaining 
			this on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/01/07/iphone-devsugar-simple-table-badges/">TUAW</a>). TDBadgedCell was 
			written originally using CGPaths but as more people began to use TDBadgeCell the more customisation people wanted 
			and the class now uses CALayers.

				<h3><i class="icon-wrench"></i> Adding badges to your UITableViewCell's</h3>
				<p>TDBadgedCell behaves like anyother UITableViewCell subclass and can be called and dequed in 
					<em>cellForRowAtIndexPath:</em> like Apple's standard table view cell class. (See below for an example)</p>
			
<pre><code data-language="c">- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath 
{
	static NSString *CellIdentifier = @"Cell";
	TDBadgedCell *cell = (TDBadgedCell *)[tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
	
	if(cell == nil)
		cell = [[[TDBadgedCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle 
					reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease];
	cell.badgeString = @"100";
	return cell;
}</code></pre>
		
			<p style="margin-bottom:20px">There you have it. Table view cells with badges just like apples own apps. Badges should be 
				used to notify a user of a variable number of items waiting for their attention on the next view controller. For 
				example the number of emails in an inbox, the number of unread direct messages for their twitter account, or game 
				invites pending.</p>

		<h3><i class="icon-eye-open"></i> Customising, changing the look and feel&hellip;</h3>
		<img src="images/badges.png" height="218px" width="320px" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0 20px" alt="s" />
		<p>You're able to change the badge's colour for both normal and highlighted states, the colour of the badged text (by default the 
			text is cut out of the badge), the radius of the badges corners, and whether or not to display shadows on highlighted states.</p>
		
		<p>Below are some example snippets showing what properties TDBadgedCell has to offer and how to modify the look and feel of your 
			TDBadgedCell badges.</p>

		<section class="readme">
			<p style="margin-top:30px"><strong>Changing the badge's colour</strong><br/>
				You can set both the normal colour of the badge and its highlighted colour. The defaults are very similar to the iPhone and 
				Mac Mail application.
			</p>
			
			<pre><code data-language="c">/* Set the badge colour for the normal state */
cell.badgeColor = [UIColor blueColor];

/* Set the badge colour for the highlighted state */
cell.badgeColorHighlighted = [UIColor pinkColor];</code></pre>

			<p style="margin-top:30px"><strong>Setting the badge's text color</strong><br/>
				You can set both the normal colour of the badge and its highlighted colour. The defaults are very similar to the iPhone and Mac 
				Mail application.
			</p>

			<pre><code data-language="c">/* Set the text colour for all states */
cell.badgeTextColor = [UIColor grayColor];</code></pre>

			<p style="margin-top:30px"><strong>Setting the badge's shadows</strong><br/>
				TDBadgedCell provides you with the option to enable drop shadows on title labels, detail text labels, and badges when the 
				cell is selected. This is off by default but can add a lil-something to your cells.
			</p>

			<pre><code data-language="c">/* Set the text colour for all states */
cell.showShadow = YES;</code></pre>
